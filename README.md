[SimpleCrop.jl](https://github.com/cropbox/SimpleCrop.jl) is an implementation of [SimpleCrop](https://github.com/DSSAT/SimpleCrop) model which was introduced as an example of how [DSSAT](https://dssat.net/models-overview/modular-approach-example/) models were structured in a modular approach. The original model was coded in Fortran and here reimplemented in a domain-specific language based on Julia using [Cropbox](https://github.com/cropbox/Cropbox.jl) framework.
